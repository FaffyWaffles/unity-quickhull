A Unity implementation of the Quickhull algorithm for generating 3D
convex hulls.

The only file that matters is ConvexHullCalculator.cs in the Scripts
folder. It defines a class called ConvexHullCalculator that can
calculate 3D convex hulls from a point cloud containing at least 4
points. It returns lists of vertices, triangles and normals suitable
to be directly converted into a Mesh (see example). 

If there are less than 4 points, or if all points are coplanar, the
calculator will throw an exception, as 3D convex hulls aren't really
defined in those cases.

The class uses a number of internal buffers for doing the calculation,
but they are all reused for subsequent calculations in order to avoid
generating garbage.

You can run the calculator on background threads without issue, but
the same calculator cannot be shared by multiple threads. If you want
to parallelize hull generation, use one calculator per thread.
